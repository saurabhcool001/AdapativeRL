# AdapativeRL
This project is to explore how an RL agent, which acts as a behaviour controller for virtual agents, can learn to  trigger anxiety-related responses in a player via adaptive interactions and behaviours. The virtual agent  exhibits varying proximity, eye contact (staring), and movement patterns, these all are driven by an evolving  policy aimed at maximizing a behavioural proxy for anxiety. Real-time behavioural inputs such as gaze  aversion, head turning, retreating steps and emergency interaction (e.g. pressing a panic button on  controller) will serve as indicators of the playerâ€™s affective state.This project is particularly relevant in the  context of naturalistic VR experience. The use of Meta Quest 3 and OpenXR mimics more closely real world behaviour and scenarios.
